        <p class="description">42 is an NGO of higher education, it is project-driven and based around peer-to-peer methodology. It focuses on practical, technical skills like programming in C and C++, but also emphasizes soft skills like explaining difficult concepts, code review, sharing knowledge and working in teams. Some of my projects included making my own: shell, ray-tracer (yes, a ray-tracer, not a ray-caster), fractal sets (Mandelbrot, Julia, Burningship), a 2D game as well as my own library to use throughout my projects. Most of them written in C with a very limited set of low-level functions.</p>
